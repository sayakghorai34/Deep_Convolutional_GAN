# Deep_Convolutional_GAN

##### Implementing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using Pytorch from scratch, using the hyperparameters and configuration mentioned in the paper "Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Radford et al. (2016).

##### Built on 1 channel MNIST image dataset. I had tried to expand this for 3 channel RGB image but maybe as it is extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, it came up with random noise in each channel creating noisy unusable images.

## Here are some tensorboard snippets across the process

##### There are many steps after this. But these are the steps where it shows significantly good results.
